## Application :

 -   Temperature  based  fan  speed  controller  is  useful  for  cooling the  processor  in  the  laptops  and  personal  computers more efficiently. Generally  fan  in  laptop  comes  with  only  two  or three possible speeds. So it results in more power consumption.
 -   The  fan  designed  in  this  project,  has  different  values  of speed  according  to  temperature  change.  This  can  be  also  used  in small  scale  industries  for  cooling  the  electrical/mechanical equipment.
