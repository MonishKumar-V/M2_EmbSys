## Introduction :

The main intention behind this temperature controlled fan is to automatically control the speed of the fan based on the room temperature variations. 

we will be able to adjust the fan speed in our home or office according to the room temperature and also show the temperature and fan speed changes on a LCD display. 

Temperature sensor is used to read the room temperature and it is sent to the ADC to convert the analog signal to digital signal. This signal is sent to micro-controller and it processes the input and the fan speed is adjusted with the help of actuators. The Temperature reading and the respective fan speed is displayed on the LCD display.
